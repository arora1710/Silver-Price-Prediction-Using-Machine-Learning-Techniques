# Silver Price Prediction Using Machine Learning Techniques

This project aims to predict silver prices using supervised machine learning techniques applied to historical market data. The goal is to analyze past price trends, identify important influencing factors, and build a predictive model that can forecast future silver prices with reasonable accuracy.

The project follows a complete data analysis and machine learning workflow, including data collection, data cleaning, preprocessing, and feature engineering. Multiple machine learning algorithms were implemented and evaluated using Python to determine the most effective model based on performance metrics such as accuracy and error rates.

Data visualization techniques were used to explore trends, patterns, and correlations within the dataset, making the insights easy to understand for both technical and non-technical audiences. The project demonstrates practical experience in predictive analytics, real-world financial data handling, and machine learning model development.
